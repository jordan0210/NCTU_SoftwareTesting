# Continuous Integration

## Part A

- Test java.util.PriorityQueue class with Junit
	- import java.util.PriorityQueue;
- Parameterization
  - Each testcase : { random array } , { correct array }.
	- Random array means to specify your own input array.
	- Correct array means the PriorityQueue polling correct order instead of using toArray().
	- e.g. arguments(new int[]{5, 4, 2, 3}, new int[]{2, 3, 4, 5})
  - Your test must have at least 5 unique testcases.
- Exception
  - You have to test at least 3 unique Exceptions that is thrown by PriorityQueue.
  - The same exception in different ways is accepted.

## Part B

- Travis-CI
  - Authorize Travis CI with your Github account.
  - Make sure that Travis CI can build and test automatically.
- Github
  - Deploy your Part A (PriorityQueueTest.java) on Github in public.
  - The name with repository is your student id.
  - You must have two commit :
    - Pass all test cases
    - Changing your testcase make it fail
  - Add Travis CIâ€™s build mark  and result (Pass and Fail) screenshots to your README.md file.
- Upload the URL of your Github repo to E3.
